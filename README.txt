Hello! I am Kushagra Rastogi, currently enrolled in the Master's program for Business Analytics with a focus on Data Science at the University of Texas at Dallas. With an extensive background spanning over six years across diverse industries including Hospitality, Automobile, Fintech, and ITSM, I possess a profound passion for leveraging data to derive actionable insights. My professional journey encompasses over four plus years of hands-on experience in data analysis, ETL processes, interactive dashboard development, building robust data pipelines, and predictive modeling. I am proficient in a range of tools and technologies including SQL, Python, R, Tableau, AWS, Machine Learning, etc.

My fascination with technology since childhood, coupled with my upbringing in a business-oriented family, naturally gravitated me towards the intersection of business and technology. The compelling synergy between business strategy and technological innovation in the realm of data science captivated me, motivating my decision to pursue a master's degree in Business Analytics from one of the premier business schools in the United States.

In terms of leadership and organizational contributions, I currently serve as a Tableau Academic Ambassador, actively promoting the utilization of Tableau for academic and analytical purposes. Additionally, I play a mentoring role within the Business Analytics Leadership Council at UT Dallas, guiding and supporting fellow students in their academic and professional endeavors.
